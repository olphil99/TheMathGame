This file contains the information regarding who on our team did what.

Firstly, almost all of the work done on this project was done together on a TV screen in the basement of Grainger. This project was a completely collaborative effort, and everyone contributed valuable ideas, information, and code.

Olivia came up with the concept of the game, and drew up the basic wireframe. She created the classes for creating the math problems, and worked with her partners to create much of the functionality within the Java Activity classes.

Mackenzie created TheGame interface, before her Android Studio stopped working. From there, she designed most of the Results page on my computer. She also researched many of the concepts we used in our project.

Nicole created the StartScreen interface, and worked on a lot of formatting within the project. If there was an issue with the layout, Nicole solved it.

Overall, the project went well, and we are all very satisfied with the results.
